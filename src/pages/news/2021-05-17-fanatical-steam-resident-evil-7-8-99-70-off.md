The Steam version for Resident Evil 7 is on 70% off until May 23rd.  

You follow Ethan Winters on his search of his missing wife, where he got kidnapped and tortured by a family of murderous cannibals known as the Bakers. Resident Evil 7 promised more horror, as the new first-person perspective renders exploration to be a much more terrifying experience.
