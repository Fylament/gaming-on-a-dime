Mi'pu'mi Games' narrative adventure The Lion’s Song has arrived on Epic Games for free this Thursday. This release features all four episodes of the game.

Upon starting off, you are greeted with the bustling of a train station in the heart of Vienna, as you set off on a journey following our main characters: Wilma Doerfl the well acclaimed debut musician facing her writer’s block, Franz Markert the painter who sees people in facets of their personalities, and Emma Recniczek on overcoming her societal struggles to prove her theory of changes.

The game treats you with its incredible soundtrack and sound design, both augmenting the experience and the anxiety each character undergoes. Wilma's racing heartbeat in a squeaking cabin in the middle of a storm engulfs you in her fear of failure. Until a call from a dear stranger rang that you know everything's going to be okay. The game has its' charming way to put you in the characters' shoes.  

Our characters' journey in 20th century Austria is depicted with a sepia-washed pixel art style, which turned out to be very pleasing. The visual sheds out the feelings of isolation, fear, and anxiety hidden in our characters, while successfully brings out the beauty of old time Vienna at the same time. Character movements are fluid with no little details in expressions left uncovered.

The game's charm is in replaying, in which you see different outcomes that manifest as you make different choices for each gameplay. The story, however, feels pretty short in each episode. Admittedly not long enough for me to root for any of the characters. The point-and-click aspect of the game also ended up being underwhelming, as the only use of it is to drive narratives through already obvious choices.  

The Lion's Song is a compelling story about young, talented individuals facing their struggles for creativity, human connections, and inspiration. And while the character building and point-of-click aspect fell short, you're still in for a treat of exploring various outcomes that came from our characters' choices.
