The other day I was exploring reddit and stumbled upon a niche subreddit named r/MechanicalKeyboards. Inside were, admittedly, pretty sick looking keyboards setups. 

Most went along with the traditional QWERTY layout and form. While others, decided to get creative with their arrangements.[ Seriously, look at some of the submissions.](https://imgur.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards)

These bad boys, however, often come with a huge price tag compared to conventional membrane keyboards. A typical keyboard made by well-known brands can go as high as $200+. Yet they are often recommended by the community as they are more “tactile”.

So naturally, I went on some digging as to why is it so good, they say “once you go mech, you can’t go back”. 

Here’s what I found.

1. They’re more responsive than regular keyboards

   The way mechanical keyboards differ from regular membrane keyboards is on how they use spring-loaded keycaps. These physical switches will bounce the key back upon being pressed, which produces a unique noise and feel to it. 

   But here’s more: mechanical keyboards require less force to register. This means that when used in games that requires high amount of action per given time, you will feel less fatigued and generally input faster than what is possible with regular keyboards. 

   Of course, it won’t turn you into an AWP-no scope-killing machine right off the gate. But still, it’s a nice quality upgrade from your typical keyboard.
2. The clicking noises are addictive

   If you are not familiar with how mechanical keyboards sound like, these guys made a tool to let you play mechanical keyboard noises as you type.  [Go ahead and use it for several minutes, see if it suits you.](https://mechvibes.com/.)

   Most people loved it, others not so much. Mostly because the noise produced might bother people around as you hit the keys. For that reason, you can opt for linear switches as they produce less noise while maintaining the responsiveness of a mechanical keyboard.

   But if you’re into the noise like me, you can opt for the tactile switch or the clicky switch. The tactile switch provides a small bump as you press on the key, which adds an extra bit of feedback on your action. The clicky switch adds an extra sound when you reach the trigger.
   For office uses or in crowded places, I would recommend using the linear switch. If you’re working alone or if you’re sure no one would be bothered, feel free to choose any of these three variants.
3. They are more durable than regular keyboards

   With how they’re built, mechanical keyboards are generally much more durable than regular membrane keyboards. A cherry MX switches can last approximately 20-50 million clicks, while regular keycaps might only last for around 5 million clicks.

   In addition, since most parts are easily replaceable, repairing is much easier and probable compared to regular keyboards.
4. Customization!

   If you’ve clicked on a link I posted above, you might’ve noticed how the community is very keen on customizing their builds. Mechanical keyboards are very much customizable as most parts are replaceable and can be easily produced. Check out r/MechanicalKeyboards for more ideas.
5. They are generally more expensive than regular keyboards.

   A typical mechanical keyboard can cost you around $50-100 for a decent one, with high-end models starting at around $150. Customizing your own build can vary from around $100 to $200 depending on your choice of parts. Compared to standard membrane keyboards that are priced around $10-$50, you might see how this can be a letdown to some.

My personal advice is to avoid bigger brands that market their keyboards as “gaming keyboard”. They often offer little improvements at a much higher price. Instead, opt for brands that are already well-known within the community. 

For reference, here are some of the most recommended products available under $100. 

* [Redragon K552 with Red Switches](https://amzn.to/3usKX53). Cheapest one I could find with pretty good build quality at $25.49. Red switches are the lightest and also make less noise than other variants.
* [Cooler Master CK530](https://amzn.to/3txUTck). Cooler Master is pretty well-known for their mechanical keyboards. Good build quality and fully customizable RGB. The blue switches are clicky switches that produce noises on keypress.
* [Durgod Taurus K320](https://amzn.to/2PYezIz). No RGB backlight. Amazing build quality with double-shot keycaps. Comes with a software to remap and set up macros for your keyboard.
* [Velocifire TKL02 with brown switch](https://amzn.to/3trXFQa), which is pretty rare for keyboards of this budget. Brown switches produces less sound than blue switches and springs back quickly.

The choice of using mechanical keyboards or not boils down to whether if you find the qualities provided is worth the investment made. As I’ve pointed earlier, using a mechanical keyboard won’t singlehandedly improves your skills. Still, it’s a nice quality upgrade from your typical keyboard.
