![(PC) Which MOBA Game Should You Play in 2021?](/img/featured-pc-which-moba-game-should-you-play-in-2021-.jpg "(PC) Which MOBA Game Should You Play in 2021?")

The Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre, or often known as MOBAs, has been drowning in popularity for the past 10 years. As of March 2021 League of Legends alone recorded over 120 million players in a month.  

One of the key reasons for the popularity of MOBA games is how the games are designed to be accessible by most PCs. Highly accessible and addictive with a huge fanbase all over the internet, the MOBA genre is a staple for low-end gaming.

You might have played one or two MOBAs before, and are looking for new titles to try out. Or you might not have played any MOBA titles before and are looking for the best one for you. With this in mind, let’s compare some of the most well-known MOBA titles out there.

1. League of Legends

      Developed and published by Riot Games, League is currently the title with the most player base. Built as a stand-alone game inspired by the Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft 3, League offers the similar premise of five players facing each other to push through and destroy the opposing team’s “Nexus”.

   * A large playable character pool consisting of 155 champions (April 2021)
   * Free champion rotation that cycles weekly
   * Largest player base, with 115 million average monthly players in 2021
   * Average Game can last around 15-45 minutes
   * Frequent patches. Around 3-5 new champions get released each year.
