We get it. Waiting for your model to crunch your data or your co-worker to call back can get a bit boring. While you certainly can’t fit a match of league into that waiting time, these games we’ve curated are bite-sized games you can alt+tab when you need to get back to work.
Below we listed our top 5 free-to-play games you can play while at work.

1. Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm  

   Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm is an idle strategy management game based on Dungeon & Dragons. You’ll set off on a journey where you will manage your best champions, formations, and gears to progress through the game. The game has a very deep level of progression and huge number of strategies to be applied. It’s a perfect game to set and forget, as most part of the game won’t require constant attention.  
2. Soda Dungeon 2  

   Soda Dungeon 2 is a turn-based dungeon crawler where you recruit soda-drunken allies to face against the Dark Lord. You recruit new allies at the tavern, upgrade your home base, and obtain loots from the dungeon. The game features toggleable auto-combat and even rewards you when you’re away from the game. Soda Dungeon 2 is also available on android and iOS with cross-platform saves.  
3. OpenTTD  

   OpenTTD is a business simulation game based on 1995 Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Build and upgrade network of roads, railways, docks, and airports to connect between cities and industries. As the game goes new modes of transports are invented, and industries come and go. Adapt and overcome to become the best business of all. The game is also available in multiplayer mode. Community-made mods are also available to extend the game even more.

Also available for both android and iOS.  
5. PokeMMO  

   If you are into Pokemon, there is a fan-made MMO pokemon game named PokeMMO. You get to play across Kanto, Hoenn, Unova, and Sinnoh while interacting with other players. Other MMO functionalities such as PVP, trading, chat, and adding friends are also available. Although the game has a questionable legality since it requires you to supply it with a rom file of the actual Nintendo games, pokeMMO is the closest game we have come to a pokemon MMO.
